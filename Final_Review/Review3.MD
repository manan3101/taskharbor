## Literature Survey:

1. **[Blockchain smart contracts: Applications, challenges, and future trends](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12083-021-01127-0)** by Shafaq Naheed Khan, Faiza Loukil, Chirine Ghedira-Guegan, Elhadj Benkhelifa & Anoud Bani-Hani

   This literature survey explores the impact of blockchain technology on the financial industry, emphasizing the rise of a crypto-economy and the evolution of decentralized applications facilitated by smart contracts. Despite their potential, the survey highlights persistent concerns, such as security threats and legal issues. It categorizes existing solutions, analyzes relevant research papers, and identifies challenges, paving the way for future studies to address issues and enhance the adoption of blockchain-enabled smart contracts. The survey concludes by outlining future trends in this rapidly evolving field.

2. **[A systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications: Current status, classification and open issues](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585318306324)** by Fran Casino, Thomas K. Dasaklis, Constantinos Patsakis

   This literature survey systematically reviews blockchain-based applications across multiple domains, aiming to understand the current state of blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize conventional practices. The work analyzes research papers from high-ranking scientific journals over the past decade, along with reports from grey literature, providing a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications
## Literature Survey (Continued):

3. **[A Blockchain-based User Authentication Model Using MetaMask](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370339058_A_Blockchain-based_User_Authentication_Model_Using_MetaMask)** by Van Giang Phan Mai, Lã Minh Vũ,  Đỗ Hoàng Sơn, Nguyễn Tuấn Khải

   This paper introduces a novel authentication model designed to combat personal information takeover and theft by service providers relying on centralized servers for user authentication and personal data management. To address the centralization challenge, the proposed model leverages blockchain, a decentralized platform. This blockchain-based solution offers user authentication, dedicated information storage space, and user-specific symmetric key encryption. In practical implementation, the Ethereum public blockchain and the MetaMask web-based wallet extension are employed. Users utilize MetaMask to access the Ethereum main network through their browsers and securely deposit their encrypted personal information into a Smart Contract. The core concept revolves around the cryptographic ease of proving account ownership by signing data with a private key. In essence, this authentication model utilizes blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum, to decentralize user authentication and personal data management, enhancing security and mitigating the risks associated with centralized systems. The use of Smart Contracts ensures secure storage of encrypted personal information, providing users with greater control and ownership over their data.

4. **[Security Evaluation and Improvement of Solidity Smart Contracts](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4038087)** by Mirko Staderini, Andràs Pataricza, Andrea Bondavalli

   This research focuses on addressing the potential security risks associated with smart contracts, which are a key innovation in the second generation of Blockchain. The automated execution of flawed contracts poses a significant threat, as smart contracts are immutable once stored on a Blockchain. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers, leading to critical consequences, including substantial financial losses. The study specifically examines the capabilities of various static analyzers for Solidity, the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.

   The paper introduces a classification of 33 Solidity vulnerabilities into a language-independent taxonomy based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). It then conducts a comparative analysis of selected static analysis tools to detect these vulnerabilities within a representative set of smart contracts. The research concludes by analyzing and prioritizing the vulnerabilities that remain uncovered. This analysis serves as a valuable indicator for developers, offering insights into the most severe vulnerabilities not addressed by existing static analysis tools. The goal is to empower developers to enhance the impact of these tools in bolstering smart contract security by focusing on the identification and mitigation of the most critical vulnerabilities.

5. **[Testing Smart Contracts Using Ganache](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335657674_Testing_Smart_Contracts_Using_Ganache)** by Wei-Meng Lee

   The literature survey explores the process of testing smart contracts using Ganache, a local blockchain emulator and development tool. The focus is on understanding and implementing testing methodologies for smart contracts within the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Ganache, as a tool, provides a controlled environment for testing smart contracts, offering features for ease of development and testing. The survey likely delves into various aspects of testing, including functionalities such as deploying contracts, interacting with them, and assessing their behavior under different conditions.

   The summary would involve insights into the testing practices recommended in the surveyed literature, potential challenges encountered during the testing process, and how Ganache is utilized to streamline and facilitate smart contract testing. It may also touch upon the advantages of using Ganache as a testing tool, such as its convenience in providing a local blockchain environment for testing without the need for real network transactions.
