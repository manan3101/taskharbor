The work analyzes research papers from high-ranking scientific journals over the past decade, along with reports from grey literature, providing a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications
## Literature Survey (Continued):

3. **[A Blockchain-based User Authentication Model Using MetaMask](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370339058_A_Blockchain-based_User_Authentication_Model_Using_MetaMask)** by Van Giang Phan Mai, Lã Minh Vũ,  Đỗ Hoàng Sơn, Nguyễn Tuấn Khải

   This paper introduces a novel authentication model designed to combat personal information takeover and theft by service providers relying on centralized servers for user authentication and personal data management. To address the centralization challenge, the proposed model leverages blockchain, a decentralized platform. This blockchain-based solution offers user authentication, dedicated information storage space, and user-specific symmetric key encryption. In practical implementation, the Ethereum public blockchain and the MetaMask web-based wallet extension are employed. Users utilize MetaMask to access the Ethereum main network through their browsers and securely deposit their encrypted personal information into a Smart Contract. The core concept revolves around the cryptographic ease of proving account ownership by signing data with a private key. In essence, this authentication model utilizes blockchain technology, specifically Ethereum, to decentralize user authentication and personal data management, enhancing security and mitigating the risks associated with centralized systems. The use of Smart Contracts ensures secure storage of encrypted personal information, providing users with greater control and ownership over their data.

4. **[Security Evaluation and Improvement of Solidity Smart Contracts](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4038087)** by Mirko Staderini, Andràs Pataricza, Andrea Bondavalli

   This research focuses on addressing the potential security risks associated with smart contracts, which are a key innovation in the second generation of Blockchain. The automated execution of flawed contracts poses a significant threat, as smart contracts are immutable once stored on a Blockchain. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers, leading to critical consequences, including substantial financial losses. The study specifically examines the capabilities of various static analyzers for Solidity, the primary programming language for Ethereum smart contracts.

   The paper introduces a classification of 33 Solidity vulnerabilities into a language-independent taxonomy based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). It then conducts a comparative analysis of selected static analysis tools to detect these vulnerabilities within a representative set of smart contracts. The research concludes by analyzing and prioritizing the vulnerabilities that remain uncovered. This analysis serves as a valuable indicator for developers, offering insights into the most severe vulnerabilities not addressed by existing static analysis tools. The goal is to empower developers to enhance the impact of these tools in bolstering smart contract security by focusing on the identification and mitigation of the most critical vulnerabilities.

5. **[Testing Smart Contracts Using Ganache](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335657674_Testing_Smart_Contracts_Using_Ganache)** by Wei-Meng Lee

   The literature survey explores the process of testing smart contracts using Ganache, a local blockchain emulator and development tool. The focus is on understanding and implementing testing methodologies for smart contracts within the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Ganache, as a tool, provides a controlled environment for testing smart contracts, offering features for ease of development and testing. The survey likely delves into various aspects of testing, including functionalities such as deploying contracts, interacting with them, and assessing their behavior under different conditions.

   The summary would involve insights into the testing practices recommended in the surveyed literature, potential challenges encountered during the testing process, and how Ganache is utilized to streamline and facilitate smart contract testing. It may also touch upon the advantages of using Ganache as a testing tool, such as its convenience in providing a local blockchain environment for testing without the need for real network transactions.

   - By eliminating a central authority, users can have confidence in the integrity and security of their information.

3. *Immutable Task Records:*
   - The immutability of blockchain records in TaskHarbor means that once a task is created or updated, the information is permanently recorded on the blockchain.
   - This creates a transparent and auditable history of all task-related activities, enhancing accountability and traceability.

4. *Smart Contract Integration:*
   - The use of smart contracts in TaskHarbor automates various task-related actions, such as task completion verification.
   - This not only streamlines the task management process but also ensures trustless interactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and enhancing overall efficiency.

By incorporating these blockchain features, TaskHarbor not only addresses common issues related to trust, accountability, and data security in traditional task management systems but also introduces a novel paradigm for task management. The application of blockchain technology to this well-studied problem provides a fresh perspective and sets TaskHarbor apart as a secure, transparent, and trustable task management solution.

## Challenges and Limitations:

1. *Blockchain Scalability:*
   - *Challenge:* Blockchain platforms, particularly Ethereum, may face scalability issues leading to slower transaction processing times.
   - *Limitation:* The scalability limitations could impact the real-time responsiveness of TaskHarbor, affecting user experience during peak usage periods.

2. *User Adoption and Familiarity:*
   - *Challenge:* Users may be unfamiliar with blockchain technology, potentially leading to resistance or hesitation in adopting TaskHarbor.
